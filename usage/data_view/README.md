## Data View

Once you have a Project and Data Design running and you have entered Objects or Categories, you can view your data. When you go to the Data module, you see a menu with the Types, Classifications, and Reversed Classifications enabled within the currently active project. The Types can be accessed via the tab 'Types' while the Classifications can be accessed via the tab 'Classification' and the Reversed Classifications can be accessed via the tab 'Reversed Classifications'. You can activate or deactive these elements and specify a custom order in which they appear in the settings of the Project.

### Overview
After you have clicked one of the buttons to open a Type, Classification, or Reversed Classification, you see an overview of Objects, Categories, or Reversed Classifications respectively. This overview is sorted on date modified. The overview can be sorted on data present in other columns by clicking a column heading. The columns you see reflect the settings as specified in the Data Design. There you can select whether you want to include the Names in the overview and which Descriptions should be included. The last column 'V' is always present and contains information about the version (date/time modified). By clicking the column heading 'V' you sort the overview on date modified.

#### Quicksearch
At the top of the overview of Objects, Categories, and Reversed Classifications, a search bar is present. The text entered here searches the Names and Descriptions that have been identified in the Data Design to be searched by the quicksearch functionality. This allows you to quikcly find something whithout using a Filter. You can also quickly find an Object, a Category, or Reversed Classification by entering the nodegoat ID in the Quicksearch bar.

#### Pagination
At the top of the overview of Objects, Categories, and Reversed Classifications, you can specify the number of rows shown per page. The number of results and the total number of Objects, Categories, and Reversed Classifications is also shown here. Using the page buttons, you can navigate to other pages.

### Single Object, Category, or Reversed Classification View
Clicking one Object, Category, or Reversed Classification shows the element in view mode. Using the blue 'edit' button, you can open the element in edit mode.

#### Sub-Objects
In case one or more Sub-Objects are present, they will be shown in an overview. In case more than one kind of Sub-Objects are present, each kind of Sub-Object is accessible via a tab. All the different kinds of Sub-Objects are shown together in one overview that shows all the temporal and geographical information.

The tab 'Cross-Referenced' shows all the related Objects and Categories that have referenced the element. In other words: all the incoming relationships are shown here.
