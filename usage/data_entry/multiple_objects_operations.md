### Multiple Objects Operations
In the top right corner of the overview of Objects and Categories, a grey 'multi' button can be clicked. Once clicked, this button reveals three buttons: a blue 'c' button for 'Change', a blue 'm' button for 'Merge', and a red 'd' button for 'Delete'. By using these buttons, actions can be performed that affect mutliple Objects or Categories. The selection of affected Objects or Categories can be made by using checkboxes on the right side in the overview of Objects and Categories, by performing a filter, or by a combination of both.

#### Change
This functionality allows you to replace, append (for text, multi-value references, and non-unique Sub-Objects), and remove Object Definitions and Sub-Objects.

This functionality is heavily dependent on the active filter for text, multi-value references, and non-unique Sub-Objects: by default the filtering criteria determine the values that can be changed. You can override this behaviour and target the full Object Definition or all Sub-Objects of the same kind by disabling filtering.

#### Merge
With no Object selected in the list, a new Object will be created and the Objects will be merged sorted by their last update. When you select an Object in the list, the Objects will be merged towards the selected Object with the selected Object taking precedent.

The merged Object will retain all cross-referenced Objects. The Objects used as source will be tagged as 'deleted'. You have the option to commit or discard these changes.

#### Delete
Delete the selected Objects or Categories.
