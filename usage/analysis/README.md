## Analysis
The Analysis functionality performs graph measures and metrics on your data selection.

You can save results to the active 'workspace' or to a stored Analysis configuration. The results can be used in [Filters](/usage/filter/README.md) and [Conditions](/usage/conditions/README.md) and subsequently all other nodegoat functionalities.

Use the [Context](/usage/analysis/README.md#context) to include results saved to multiple stored Analysis configurations in the Analysis column in overviews.

### Graph
The Scope allows you to create edges between the source nodes (Objects in the selection of the currently active Type) and target nodes (Objects referenced by the indicated path in the Scope).

The currently available algorithms are:
* Count
* Shortest path
* Betweenness centrality
* Closeness centrality
* Pagerank

### Context
By selecting stored Analysis configurations in the Analysis Context settings, it is possible configure the Analysis column to be able to directly compare and sort an Object's various graph measures and metrics.
