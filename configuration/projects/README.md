## Projects

A Project is a selection of Types and Classifications to which specific settings can be assigned. You can specify the order in which the Types and Classifications are displayed, assign Project-specific colours to Types and Classifications and specify which Types can be used as Location References and Sources. Types and Classifications can be included in multiple projects.
