## Reversed Classification
Instead of identifying Classifications and assigning these to Objects, a Reversed Classification is used to define a multi-faceted filter in which any number of parameters are defined. This reverses the classifying process as the definition of the classification is identified by the exchange between parameters of the classification and attributes of the object.

To add a Reversed Classification, click 'Add Reversed Classification'.

To edit an existing Reversed Classification, click the blue 'edit' button at the relevant Reversed Classification.

To empty an existing Reversed Classification, click the red 'empty' button at the relevant Reversed Classification. This will remove all the Reversed Classifications in this Reversed Classification while leaving the Model of this Reversed Classification intact.

To delete an existing Reversed Classification, click the red 'del' button at the relevant Reversed Classification. This will remove both the Reversed Classifications in this Reversed Classification plus the Model of this Reversed Classification.
