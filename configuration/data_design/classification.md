### Classification

A Classification contains lists of categories that you use to classify objects.

Classifications should be used to label objects with statements that are made about the object by an observer. In a collection of paintings, a classification can be used with categories like 'impressionism', 'pointillism', 'cubism', 'expressionism, 'surrealism' to classify the paintings. Since you are free to structure and enter your classifications and categories, you can use your own categories or use an existing standard.

**Example:**

_In a Data Design with the Types 'Person', 'Institute', and 'Letter', you could use three Classifications: 'Gender', 'Legal entity', and 'Epistolary value'._

_The classification Gender would contain categories like 'female', 'male', 'transgender' and would be used to classify objects in the Type 'Person'._

_The classification Legal entity would contain categories like 'private company', 'governmental institute', 'association', 'NGO' and would be used to classify objects in the Type 'Institute'._

_The classification Epistolary value world contain categories like 'professional communication', 'personal communication', 'phatic communication' and would be used to classify objects in the Type 'Letter'._
