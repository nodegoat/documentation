### Object

Objects are actors (both human and non-human, e.g. a painting, a person, a city). All intrinsic aspects of an actor are stored within the Object (stored in 'Object Descriptions' and 'Sub-Objects', see below). This means that for a painting, all information regarding the genesis of the artwork is stored in the Object of the painting (in 'Sub-Objects' (see below) such as 'Commissioned by', 'Produced in Studio XYZ'). Information on the ownership of the painting could also be stored within the Object of the painting in order to store the provenance of the painting in a single Object.

Information on incidental whereabouts of a painting, on the other hand, is stored within the Object of the temporary exhibition in which the painting was displayed. In this way, an Object of the temporary or traveling exhibition will include information on the presence of the painting and refer back to the Object of the painting to establish a reciprocal relation. As a result, all intrinsic aspects of the painting are stored in one place, while non-intrinsic aspects are retrievable from within the Object of the painting as incoming relations.

There is no absolute rule prescribing this structure and you are free to design your data structure based on the needs of your own research question.

**Example:**

_When storing an Object in the Type 'Person', the first name and the second name of this person are stored in the Object of the person. This information is of intrinsic value for a person and should therefore be stored in the Object. Whether a person has sent or received a letter is not of intrinsic value for a person and should therefore not be stored in the Object of the person. This information is stored in the Object of a letter, since for a letter the information on the sender and receiver are of intrinsic value._
