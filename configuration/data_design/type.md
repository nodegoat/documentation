### Type

A Type covers the broadest definition of a set of objects within your data.

Should your dataset include a variety of persons who all have different capacities, all of them will belong to the Type 'Person'. The same approach can be applied to pieces of art such as paintings, sculptures, or copperware: all could be part of the Type 'Artefact'.

**Example:**

_To analyse personal relations by means of institutional affiliation and epistolary communication, you can use four Types: 'Person', 'Institute', 'Letter', 'City'. The Type Person contains all the Objects of persons, the Type Institute contains all institute objects, the Type Letter contains all letter Objects, and all the city Objects will be in the Type City._
