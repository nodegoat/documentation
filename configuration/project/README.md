## Project

A Project is a selection of Types and Classifications to which specific settings can be assigned. You can specify the order in which the Types and Classifications are displayed, assign Project-specific colours to Types and Classifications and specify which Types can be used as Location References and Sources. Types and Classifications can be included in multiple projects.

You could, for example, run one Project in which you manage your bibliographical data, while you conduct your research in a different project (and only refer to your Types with bibliographical data).
