# Common Use Cases

**I want to build up a data structure from scratch and start entering data**

Whether you have your data model figured out, or you want to experiment with different models, nodegoat offers you total control on the way you want to setup your data structure. This allows you to create a custom data model that fits the needs of your project. Once you have your data model in place, you can start entering your data as precise or as uncertain as you prefer.

**I have a large amount of data that I want to visualise**

Since nodegoat runs on custom built data models, you will first need to build a data design in nodegoat that suits your data. Once you have a data model up and running, you can import your data into nodegoat and visualise the data. Even though this can be done quickly and with ease, you might also want to consider software packages that focus on one-off visualisations.

**I have a group of researchers that want to collaborate on a dataset**

Since nodegoat is web-based, it runs in any browser and on any operating system. There is no need for installing a local client. nodegoat gives you all the tools you need in terms of user management, clearance levels, and communication to easily work together on a project.
