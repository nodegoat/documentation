# Domain

This section covers the modules in a nodegoat Domain. A nodegoat Domain is either a 'personal research domain' hosted on nodegoat.net (single user) or a nodegoat installation on a server (multi user). Each Domain can host one set of Types, Classifications and Reversed Classifications. In each domain, multiple Projects can be created that make use of these Types, Classifications and Reversed Classifications in varying configurations.

## Data

In Data you access the data in your project. Here you perform all data related operations (data entry, data view, filter, visualisation). See the [Usage section](/usage/README.md) for a description of these operations.

## Management

In Management you configure the settings of your nodegoat Domain.

### Projects

In Projects you create and configure projects in your Domain. See the [Project section](/configuration/projects/README.md) for a description of the role of projects and how to configure projects.

### Users

The Users module is available for multi-user nodegoat Domains. In the Users module you can create and manage user accounts of your nodegoat Domain. See the [Users section](/configuration/users/README.md) for more information on this.

### API

The nodegoat API allows external access to your projects and its data. Access can be both open (no authorisation needed) and authorised (based on the Users that are already part of the nodegoat Domain). See the [API configuration section](/configuration/API/README.md) for information on how to configure the API. The [API access section](/usage/API/README.md) provides specifications on how to query the API.

### Public Interfaces

The Public Interfaces module is available for multi-user nodegoat Domains. See the [Public Interface section](/configuration/public_interfaces/README.md) for more information on this.

## Model

### Model

In Model you create, configure and reconfigure your custom Data Model. See the [Data Model section](/configuration/data_model/README.md) for more information on how to work with Types, Classifications, and Reversed Classifications.

### Import

In Import you upload and manage your source files and create and configure your Import Templates. See the [Import Section](/configuration/import/README.md) for more information on this.

### Linked Data

In Linked Data you create and configure the linked data resources that you use in your Domain. See the [Linked Data section](/configuration/linked_data/README.md) in the Configuration section for more information on this.
